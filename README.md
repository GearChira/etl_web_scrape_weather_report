# Extract, Transform and Load weather data from wttr.in

This project aims to develop a Bash script designed to extract Bangkok weather data from an open source project wttr.in, a web service that provides weather forecast information in a simple and text-based format.

The anticipated deliverables include the raw extracted data, text file containing temperature data for the current day and the subsequent three days, and a log file documenting forecasted temperatures for both the present day and the following day.
